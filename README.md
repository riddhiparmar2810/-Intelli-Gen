# INTELLI-GEN

Welcome to **INTELLI-GEN**! This project aims to generate bulk image data from 4-5 input images, addressing the problem of dataset scarcity by automating the generation of new, realistic images based on a limited set of input data. This tool is particularly useful for training machine learning models in image-based tasks, such as computer vision applications, where a large dataset is needed.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the following key elements:

### 1. **fast-DreamBooth.ipynb**
   - This notebook is based on the DreamBooth technique and is used to fine-tune a model using a small set of input images, generating new images that reflect the features of the input data.
   - [Open fast-DreamBooth Notebook on GitHub](https://github.com/Kandarp-joshi-007/Intelli-Gen/blob/main/fast-DreamBooth.ipynb)

### 2. **Model Training Notebook**
   - This notebook provides the workflow to train the model on your own dataset. It guides you through the setup of the environment and data preparation before training.

### 3. **Image Generation Pipeline**
   - This notebook outlines the steps involved in generating images based on the trained model. It shows how to generate high-quality synthetic images for dataset expansion.
